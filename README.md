<h2>Spring Boot Sample</h2>
<p>This is just a sample Spring Boot project to get started with Velocity templates and webjars. Either run in Spring Tool Suite as a 
Spring Boot Project, or build the jar with maven. Should have an embedded tomcat that allows you to browse to <a href="http://localhost:8080/index.html">http://localhost:8080/index.html</a>, 
which is just a placeholder page.
